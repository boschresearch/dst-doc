Perun \@  Hyperledger Labs -- a blockchain-agnostic state channels framework
============================================================================

Perun is an open source project that aims to increase blockchain
transaction throughput by using just a handful of main chain
transactions to move an entire peer-to-peer network of activity off the
main chain. After an initial setup of a set of basic transaction
channels, this network lets any participant transact with any other
participant via virtual channels which do not require additional
on-chain setup. We do this by implementing the Perun protocol, which has
been formally proven to allow for secure off-chain transactions.
